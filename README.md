# Youtube Bot

This is a HORRIBLE MUSIC BOT FOR DISCORD WRITTEN IN RUST   
THIS IS BAD.   
DO NOT ACTUALLY USE THIS.   
But yea rust is kinda cool ig

Ok actually, this bot was my attempt to get comfortable with Rust and Serenity. Super simple and light, so will be good for those late night sessions with the lads ðŸ”¥
